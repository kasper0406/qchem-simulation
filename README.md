## qchem-simulation

Neural variational Monte Carlo (VMC) playground for small quantum chemistry systems. It models electronic structure with a Slater-Jastrow-style wave function parameterized by neural networks (Flax nnx), samples electrons via MCMC (BlackJAX), and optionally optimizes nuclear positions.
